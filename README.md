# Werlabs
This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.
We used to angular-cli commands to manage project.

If `angular-cli` is not already installed in your system then run `npm install -g angular-cli`.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Testing
Run `ng test` to run test cases.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Docker
Run `docker-compose build` to build docker image.
After creating image run `docker-compose up` then we can access app on `http://localhost:4200/`.
